## Project Overview

VI is a virtual tour of Ireland aimed at people planning on visiting Ireland, people who cannot visit or people who want to look back on trips to some of Ireland’s most beautiful sites.

## UX

VI is aimed at B2C users. Users expect to be able to experience a place and learn more about it without physically being there. The content is a mix of historical, mythological, anecdotal, cultural and geological information on Ireland’s most famous sites aided by imagery (my own photographs). The content is divided into pages based on regions; West, North and South with a direct link to each from the homepage and links to sections of pages for specific locations.

### User Stories

- User Story A: Joe visited Ireland last year and wants to relive the experience and share with others what he saw.
- User Story B: Amanda is planning a trip to Europe and is trying to decide if she wants to include Ireland in her trip and wants to know more about things she might see here.
- User Story C: Liz has been to some of the locations and wants some deeper background information.

### Design

A standard layout is fully responsive on mobile devices and larger screens.

#### Libraries

- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - is a framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites. I primarily used bootstrap to format layouts and for certain components such as buttons and carousel.

#### Color Scheme

Colours are kept to a bare minimum, using only the colors for bootstrap bg-light, bg-dark and one green.

- ![#343a40](https://placehold.it/15/55928d/343a40)

4 [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used across the site:

- [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) : body text
- [Marcellus](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marcellus?query=marcellus) : blockquote
- [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?query=quicksand) : Logo (animated)
- [Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico?query=pacifico) : Logo (solid)

### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq to create the wireframes.

## Features

### Existing Features

- Index - The index uses three videos as links to the regions North, West and East. I used Google Earth studio to simulate drone footage of the locations, Google Earth Studio is free source once attributed with a watermark.

- North/West/East - These pages use CSS Grid in order to preview the location pages.

- Various - The individual location pages use floated bootstrap carousels, blockquotes and paragraphs to showcase the sites, history and mythology of various locations around Ireland.

- About - This section displays an image and short bio.

- Contact - This section has a form where users can sign up for updates.

### Features Left to Implement

- Google Streetview - this may be used to p rovide 360 degree views of the locations.
